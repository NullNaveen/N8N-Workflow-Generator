## 🎯 What The Files You Had Are

### workflows/ folder (2000+ JSON files)
**What they are:** Real n8n workflow examples from the community

**What I did with them:**
- Analyzed the structure to understand n8n format
- Studied common patterns (triggers → actions)
- Used them to create training examples for the AI

**What you can do:**
- Browse them for inspiration
- See what's possible with n8n
- Learn workflow patterns

### n8n_nodes/ folder (200+ empty folders)
**What they are:** Directory structure representing all available n8n node types (Gmail, Slack, Sheets, etc.)

**What I did with them:**
- Identified which services n8n supports
- Built a mapping of service names to node types
- Used them to teach the AI which nodes exist

**What you can do:**
- See which services are available
- Reference when building custom workflows

```
Good: "When I receive an email"
Good: "Every day at 9am"
Good: "When a new row is added"
```

#### ✅ Start Simple
```
Try: Basic 2-node workflows first
Then: Build more complex ones
```
