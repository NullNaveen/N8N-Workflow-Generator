5. **The AI will respond** with your workflow details
6. **Click "Download Workflow JSON"** button
7. **Save the file** somewhere you can find it

### What Just Happened?
‚úÖ You described an automation in plain English  
‚úÖ The AI converted it to n8n format  
‚úÖ You got a downloadable file ready for n8n  

---

## üì• PART 4: IMPORTING TO N8N

### Step 1: Open n8n
- If you don't have n8n yet:
  - Cloud version: https://n8n.io (sign up for free)
  - Self-hosted: Follow n8n documentation

### Step 2: Import Your Workflow
1. In n8n, click the **"+"** button (top left) to create new workflow
2. Click the **three dots menu** (‚ãÆ) in the top right
3. Select **"Import from File"**
4. Choose the JSON file you downloaded
5. The workflow will appear on your canvas!

### Step 3: Configure & Activate
1. **Click on each node** to configure it
2. **Add credentials** for services (Gmail, Sheets, etc.)
   - Each service will ask you to connect your account
3. **Test the workflow** by clicking "Execute Workflow"
4. **Activate it** using the toggle switch

---

## üé® PART 5: EXAMPLES TO TRY

### Example 1: Email Automation
**Prompt**: "Send an email when a new row is added to Google Sheets"
**What it creates**: 
- Trigger: Google Sheets (watches for new rows)
- Action: Gmail (sends email)

### Example 2: Task Management
**Prompt**: "Create a Trello card when I receive an email"
**What it creates**:
- Trigger: Gmail (watches for emails)
- Action: Trello (creates card)

### Example 3: Daily Reminders
**Prompt**: "Post to Slack every day at 9am"
**What it creates**:
- Trigger: Schedule (runs at 9am daily)
- Action: Slack (sends message)

### Example 4: Webhook Integration
**Prompt**: "Save webhook data to Airtable"
**What it creates**:
- Trigger: Webhook (receives data)
- Action: Airtable (saves data)

---

## ‚ö° PART 6: OPTIONAL - ENABLE AI MODE (Better Results)

The app works great without this, but AI mode gives even better results!

### Get Free Groq API Key
1. Go to: **https://console.groq.com/**
2. Click **"Sign Up"** (it's free!)
3. Verify your email
4. Go to **"API Keys"** section
5. Click **"Create API Key"**
6. **Copy the key** (it looks like: `gsk_abc123...`)

### Add API Key to Your App
1. Open Notepad
2. Type exactly: `GROQ_API_KEY=` and then paste your key
3. Should look like: `GROQ_API_KEY=gsk_abc123xyz...`
4. Save the file as `.env` in your project folder
   - File name: `.env` (yes, it starts with a dot)
   - Save as type: All Files (not .txt)
   - Location: `C:\Users\Nike\Documents\Programming\Projects\N8N`
5. **Restart the application** (close the black window and run `start.bat` again)

### How to Tell If AI Mode is Active
When you start the app, the black window will say:
- `Groq API configured: Yes` ‚úÖ (AI mode active)
- `Groq API configured: No (using fallback)` (Rule-based mode)

Both modes work! AI mode just understands more complex requests.

## üîç TROUBLESHOOTING COMMON ISSUES

### Issue 1: "Python is not recognized"
**Problem**: You see this error in the command window  
**Solution**: 
1. Uninstall Python
2. Reinstall Python
3. **Make sure** to check "Add Python to PATH" during installation
4. Restart your computer

### Issue 2: "Port 5000 is already in use"
**Problem**: Another app is using port 5000  
**Solution**:
1. Close other applications
2. OR edit `app.py` and change the last line:
   - Change: `app.run(debug=True, host='0.0.0.0', port=5000)`
   - To: `app.run(debug=True, host='0.0.0.0', port=5001)`
3. Then go to: `http://localhost:5001`

### Issue 3: "Cannot connect to server"
**Problem**: Browser shows error when going to localhost:5000  
**Solution**:
1. Make sure the black window (terminal) is still open
2. Check if you see "Running on http://0.0.0.0:5000"
3. Try `http://127.0.0.1:5000` instead
4. Check your firewall isn't blocking it

### Issue 4: Workflow doesn't work in n8n
**Problem**: Downloaded workflow has errors in n8n  
**Solution**:
1. This is normal! Generated workflows are templates
2. You need to configure each node with your credentials
3. Click on each node and fill in the required fields
4. Test each node individually first

### Issue 5: AI not generating good workflows
**Problem**: Results don't match what you want  
**Solution**:
1. Be more specific in your prompt
2. Include: trigger event + action + details
3. Good: "Send a Slack message to #general channel when a new row is added to Google Sheets"
4. Bad: "do something with slack"

## üìä TESTING YOUR INSTALLATION

We included a test script! Here's how to run it:

1. Open Command Prompt (Windows Key + R, type `cmd`)
2. Navigate to project folder: `cd C:\Users\Nike\Documents\Programming\Projects\N8N`
3. Run: `python test_system.py`
4. You should see all green checkmarks ‚úÖ
5. If you see red X marks ‚ùå, follow the error messages

## üí° TIPS FOR BEST RESULTS

1. **Be Specific**: The more details you provide, the better
   - Good: "Send email to admin@example.com when new row in Sheet1"
   - Bad: "email stuff"

2. **Use Common Services**: The AI knows these well:
   - Gmail, Google Sheets, Slack, Discord, Trello, Airtable, etc.

3. **Mention Triggers Clearly**:
   - "When I receive an email..."
   - "Every day at 9am..."
   - "When a new row is added..."
   - "When a webhook receives data..."

4. **Start Simple**: Test basic workflows first, then build complexity

5. **Check Examples**: Use the provided example chips to see what works
